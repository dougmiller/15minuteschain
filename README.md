15minuteschain
==============

Dont break the chain.

15 Minutes Chain is a small project to help track daily attention on tasks you want to do.

The idea is that you will set it as your new page/tab and it will remind you about doing the things you wanted to do as well as keeping track of a small history to keep you motivated.

I decided that I had an hour to dedicate for 4 tasks so it became 15 minutes for each.

P.S. I am aware of the inefficiencies of attention switching.
